    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">In QGIS, after applying the Indicatrix layer, I changed the ESRG according to the requirements.</h2>
    <p>When projecting the spherical, or even not spherical, Earth onto a flat surface to make a map, distortion is inevitable. Several different
features can be distorted in tandem or individual elements can be lost. Conformal maps preserve shape, equal-area maps preserve area, equidistant
maps retain distance, and true-direction map preserves directions or azimuths of great circle arcs.

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection style preserves shape and area along the equator, but not north or south.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/4326.png">
    <img src=".//maps/4326.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>Shape, direction, distance, and area are all distorted, except in the central meridian.  </h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54043.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54043.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>

    <h2>World Robinson Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves shape and area only around the equator, it distorts shape just north and south of the equator,
        but preserves are, and then north and south of this it has heavy distortion of shape and area.
    </h3>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves shape and area around the equator and just north and south of it, 
        but further than that there is a lot of distortion of area. </h3>

<h2>Sphere Winkel Projection</h2>
<h3>This one is very similar to the World Robinson, with preservation of are and shape near the equator but heavy distortion as you go further north and south.</h3>

<h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
<h3>Like the Sphere Winkel and the World Robinson projections, this projection preserves area and shape closer to the equator but is 
    distorted in area and shape north and south. </h3>

<h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
<h3>This projection preserves shape and area closest to the North Pole. It is distorted in shape and area as it moves outward, and preserves distance. </h3>
<a href="./maps/World Equidistant Conic 54027.png">
<img src="./maps/World Equidistant Conic 54027.png" alt="World Equidistant Conic Projection" width='500px'>
</a>
<h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
<h3>This projection preserves distance a bit better than the World Equidistant Conic Projection, and preserves shape and area best at the North Pole. </h3>
<a href="./maps/North Pole Athizumal Equidistant 102016.png">
<img src="./maps/North Pole Athizumal Equidistant 102016.png" alt="North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant" width='500px'>
</a>
<h2>USN National Atlas Equal Area Projection</h2>
<h3>This projection only shows the Western Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere best, preserving shape and area mostly at the North Pole and in the 
    Americas. distortion in distance and shape and area is heavy for the Eastern Hemispere. </h3>

<h2>Indian 1975 Projection</h2>
<h3>This projection preserves area and shape best in the latitude of the Indian Ocean and around it, with distortions of shape and area as you move outward from this plane. </h3>
